  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I am from Warner Robins, Ga. A small city in the heart of the state.</br> Because of its military presence you meet people from all over the country and world.</br> It has allowed me to experience other places and perspectives. Through their stories and backgrounds.</br> I am grateful for this and continue to teach myself about other cultures and societies.</p>
